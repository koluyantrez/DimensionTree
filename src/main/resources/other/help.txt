DATABASE FORMAT
It must be a text file, the case where the name already exists in the folder is not directly managed by the program. A database looks like this : (let X and Y be non-zero naturals)

X
type1
...
typeX
Y
data11 data12 ... data1X
data21 data22 ... data2X
dataY1 dataY2 ... dataYX

In this program, we have to constrain the value of X to three : Double Double String

BUTTON
Attention, the file consider by all the items is the one in the selector !

With all buttons, you can :
    - Remove this file
    - Show it as a table or a tree
    - Overwrite it

Of course, you can import your file. If your file is not a text file, you cannot use it. Otherwise, it will be imported but you cannot do anything with it.

You can create your file from another with the arrow, it will give a text file with the content of the table showed.

COMMAND
It is possible to do some manipulation, you can write the file without the extension :

Renaming => RENAME old_name TO new_name

Adding => ADD data1, data2, data3 IN target_file

Removing => REMOVE id_row FROM target_file

Selecting => SELECT c1 FROM P WHERE condition1
             SELECT c1 FROM P WHERE condition1 AND condition2
             SELECT c1, c2 FROM P WHERE condition1
             SELECT c1, c2 FROM P WHERE condition1 AND condition2

Let x and y be reals, a condition can be => c >= x
                                            c <= x
                                            c in [x,y]
